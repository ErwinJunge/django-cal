Django app to enable exporting of events to iCalendar files. 
Imitates behavior of django.contrib.syndication and is based upon vobject
(http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/).

Heavy inspiration came from Christian Joergensen 
(http://www.technobabble.dk/2008/mar/06/exposing-calendar-events-using-icalendar-django/)
and Derek Willis (http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2007/07/31/django-ical-and-vobject/).

Initialliy developed by Maik Hoepfel (http://maikhoepfel.de),
for Christopher Dickes (http://statesofpop.de).
    
Documentation:
The following parameters work analagous to how they're implemented in 
django.contrib.syndication. That means, the framework checks in the following
order: self.$param(obj), self.$param(), self.$param; obj being the object 
returned by self.get_object. 

Please see contrib.syndication documentation for further explanation:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/contrib/syndication/
