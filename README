Django app to enable exporting of events to iCalendar files. 
Imitates behavior of django.contrib.syndication and is based upon vobject
(http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/).

Heavy inspiration came from Christian Joergensen 
(http://www.technobabble.dk/2008/mar/06/exposing-calendar-events-using-icalendar-django/)
and Derek Willis (http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2007/07/31/django-ical-and-vobject/).

Initialliy developed by Maik Hoepfel (http://maikhoepfel.de),
for Christopher Dickes (http://statesofpop.de).

For convenience reasons, this app ships with its own copy of vobject.
    
Documentation:
Please also see contrib.syndication documentation, django_cal copies its
behavior: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/contrib/syndication/

    get_object(self, request, *args, **kwargs)    
                    Can be overriden to allow for more complex events,
                    see syndication documentation.
                    Optional, defaults to None.
       
The following parameters work analagous to how they're implemented in 
django.contrib.syndication. That means, the framework checks in the following
order: self.$param(obj), self.$param(), self.$param; obj being the object 
returned by self.get_object. 
    
    items           Returns the list of events.
                    Must be set.
    filename        Filename of the file returned in the view. 
                    Optional, defaults to 'events.ics'.
    cal_name        Name of the calendar. Is only written to .ics file if
                    there's more than one event.
                    Optional, defaults to None.
    cal_desc        Description of the calendar. Is only written to .ics file 
                    if there's more than one event.
                    Optional, defaults to None.
    
    item_summary    The "title" of the item.
                    Optional, defaults to unicode representation of item.
    item_uid        All correspond to their vEvent equivalents.
    item_start      All optional, all default to None.
